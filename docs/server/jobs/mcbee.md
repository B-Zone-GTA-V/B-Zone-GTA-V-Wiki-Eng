To work as a <span class="button-p-job">Delivery Driver</span>, you need to head to the hiring area in Los Santos.
<br>You can use your phone <span class="button-p-job">Press L -> GPS -> Jobs -> McBeeDelivery</span>.
<br>You can become a <span class="button-p-job">Delivery Driver</span> based on your experience.
<br>The delivery driverâ€™s goal is to prepare a number of burgers <span class="button-r-job">maximum 6</span> and then deliver them to the locations marked on the <span class="button-p-job">GPS</span>. Note that the delivery locations often change.

Preparing the burgers is based on a memory game; each time you will have a different recipe to follow. If you select an incorrect ingredient, you can always return to the work table to check the recipe again. Correctly chosen ingredients are displayed differently in the interface showing the burger recipe.

#### <span class="button-p-job"><b>Note</b></span>

- If you do not ride the scooter for <span class="button-r-job">15 minutes</span>, your shift will end, and the scooter will despawn due to inactivity.
