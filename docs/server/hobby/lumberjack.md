Hobbies can be done anytime without the need for a formal job.
To cut wood, you’ll need to purchase an <span class="button-p-hobby">Axe</span>, which can be bought from the <span class="button-p-hobby">Hardware Store</span>.
Once you have the axe, you can head to the tree cutting area.

There are 3 types of wood, and you can craft different items from them at the <span class="button-p-hobby">General Craft</span> or <span class="button-p-hobby">Smelter</span>:
#### <span style="color: #0088CC">Wood Types:</span>
- <span style="fontsize: 5px"><span class="button-p-hobby">Birch</span> – What you can craft with this wood will be revealed in-game.</span>
- <span class="button-p-hobby">Oak</span> – What you can craft with this wood will be revealed in-game.
- <span class="button-p-hobby">Cedar</span> – What you can craft with this wood will be revealed in-game.

To cut down trees, go to the cutting area shown on the map, approach a tree, and press the <span class="button-p-hobby">E</span> key.
