B-Taxi is an application used to request a B-Taxi or to go on duty and pick up rides.

In order to work with the B-Taxi application, you need an active license as well as a personal vehicle. A passenger transport license is also required if you want to work legally and avoid issues with the police. As soon as you request a B-Taxi, your request will be displayed and taken over by a driver.

When a driver takes your request, you will have more information about them, such as their name, the car they will use to pick you up, and their license plate number.

The passenger is required to add their location on the GPS where they want to go. At the end of the ride, payment can be made with a card, and subsequently, a tip can be given in cash if the passenger desires.
