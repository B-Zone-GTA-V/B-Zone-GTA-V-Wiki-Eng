## White Weapons Shop

Weapon stores are those establishments where players can purchase a variety of melee weapons for self-defense or to rob other players, as follows:

Legend: W = weight | $ = price

It is important to note that melee weapons disappear from the inventory when the player decides to accept their death and respawn at the hospital.
