## Dealership

The B-Zone community has 3 representatives: Auto, Boats and Helicopters. Each dealership has 2 dealers, one for vanilla vehicles, and others for purchasing with Gold. At the Auto Dealership there is a dealer for addon vehicles.

When creating your character, you have the option to purchase a starting vehicle such as Asbo & Blista.

Each representative offers different types of vehicles categorized similarly. Each category has a limited number of vehicles in stock.

The purchase price of personal vehicles is designed based on their performance, how they can be improved through tuning, and the appearance of the body.

Certain vehicles may be more desired, so there is the possibility of adding new cars to stock based on player preferences.
