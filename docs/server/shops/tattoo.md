## Tattoo

The tattoo shop is the place where you can customize your character even more. Currently, we have a total of 5 such shops. 

Tattoos have different areas where they can be placed, such as: head, body, hands, and legs. Tattoos are considered a "luxury" on the server, therefore their price is higher compared to other ways of customizing your character. 

It's worth noting that tattoos can be removed individually according to your preferences, but the removal cost of a tattoo is much higher than the cost of acquiring it.

|Place|Price|
|-|-|
|Head|$ = 3.500|
|Body|$ = 5.500|
|Hand|$ = 4.800|
|Leg|$ = 5.000|
