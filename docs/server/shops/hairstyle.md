## Hairstyle Shop

Barber shops are the places where players can change their appearance in the game. On the B-Zone community, there are 6 barber shops available.

The price for modifying your appearance at the barber shop is fixed and does not depend on the number or type of changes you make to your character. 

Barber shops are designed in such a way that you cannot alter the original features of the character created during the account setup, such as freckles, dark circles, wrinkles, or eye color. However, you can change elements such as hair, hair color, lipstick, makeup, and beard.
