## Clothing Store

Clothing stores are special places in the game where players can change their character's wardrobe. Currently, we have a total of 14 such stores. In the store, you have the option to display your character naked to make creating an outfit from scratch much easier.

Purchased clothes are stored in the player's inventory, from where they can be equipped. A player can own multiple clothes simultaneously.

Legend: G = weight | $ = price

To buy clothes, the player needs to explore the available clothing items and add them to the shopping cart, then pay for the purchase with cash or card. It's worth noting that clothes in the inventory (those that are NOT equipped) disappear from the inventory when the player decides to accept death and respawn at the hospital.
