## Tuning Shop

The B-Zone community currently has 5 locations where you can customize your car as you wish.

Vehicle modifications remain saved whether the car is parked or not after the implemented changes. 

Each modification you add to the vehicle is calculated as a percentage of the purchased vehicle's value.

To purchase the new parts, the player needs to choose the payment method: cash or card.
