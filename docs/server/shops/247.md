## Shop 24/7

General stores, commonly known as 24/7, are those stores from which the player can purchase a variety of products, as follows: 

Legend: W = weight | % = satiety or hydration | $ = price 

To purchase products, the player needs to add them to the cart and choose the payment method: cash or card.

It is important to note that the products purchased from 24/7 disappear from the inventory when the player decides to accept their death and respawn at the hospital.
