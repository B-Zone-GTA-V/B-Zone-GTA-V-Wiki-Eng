## Account Creation

To connect to the B-Zone community server for GTA V, you need a valid account. To create an account, you require a name without special characters, a valid email address, and a secure password.

The security of the account is determined by how the password is structured. To set a password, you need at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one symbol, one number, and a total of eight characters.

Additionally, during the account registration, you can set the game language, which can be changed in real-time from the settings [/settings].

If you encounter connectivity issues (forgot your password), you can always recover it by accessing v.b-zone.ro -> Forgot Password.

## Character Creation

When the character is created, it can be partially modified based on the available options on the server (e.g., barbershops).

Only one character is valid per account, so make sure to invest time in customizing your in-game character.

Features such as freckles / nose size / cheekbones, and so on, cannot be changed after the character has been finalized!
