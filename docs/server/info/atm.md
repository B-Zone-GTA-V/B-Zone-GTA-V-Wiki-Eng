## ATM

ATMs are used to deposit or withdraw money quickly. They have predefined amounts and also provide the option to add a desired amount for player deposits/withdrawals.

From the ATM, it is not possible to withdraw or add amounts that the player does not have valid. (You cannot withdraw more money than you have in the bank/add more than you have in hand).
