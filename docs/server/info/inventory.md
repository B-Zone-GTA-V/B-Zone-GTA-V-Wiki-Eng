## Inventory

The inventory is the basic element of our server. In the inventory, you can store food, clothing items, objects obtained from jobs, and more. 

The inventory comes with a capacity of 5 kilograms, which can be increased to 45 kg by equipping a backpack. With the inventory open, you can see items thrown nearby and also throw items in the vicinity (on the ground). 

Items in the vicinity can be picked up by any player in your proximity. 
The inventory capacity cannot be increased if the player works out; this concept is NOT adopted on our server.

It is worth noting that all items in the inventory are deleted when the player accepts their death, as well as the money in hand (displayed when the inventory is open). The only items that do NOT get deleted from the inventory are the equipped ones (clothing items), except for equipped weapons.
