## Settings & Hotkeys

The B-Zone community comes with predefined settings for most actions on the server, as well as the ability to customize settings and elements in the HUD to suit individual preferences.

HUD elements that can be modified: 

- Turning off all HUD elements for a better experience 
- Adjusting blips (their size can be increased or decreased) 
- Turning off the entire chat display 
- Turning off tips 
- Font size and chat opacity 
- Placing the speedometer anywhere on the screen

Other elements that can be adjusted in real-time: 
- Game language 
- Refreshing the microphone, and many more. 

On the server, there is an option to display a compass, which helps provide details about the street you are on, using the command [/compass] in the chat.

Each hotkey can be changed by accessing the command [/settings] in the chat, and then selecting the "Taste" (Keys) category.
