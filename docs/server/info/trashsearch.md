## Search in the trash

On our server, there is the possibility to conduct searches in garbage containers to obtain not only thread but also other valuable items. Currently, 80 specific locations are arranged for this purpose across the entire server. 

It is important to note that two or more individuals cannot engage in searching activities in the same container simultaneously. After a search, the respective container will become inaccessible for a period of 10 minutes (the garbage bin will be empty).
