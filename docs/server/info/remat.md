## Vehicle Recycle Center

To sell a personal vehicle, you need to head towards the remat center. Once there, you must enter the adjacent garage and press the confirmation button (Y).

Once this button is pressed, the vehicle will be sold and despawned! You will receive 60% of the vehicle's value in your bank account. You won't be able to recover the car after pressing the confirmation button.

Be careful before selling the vehicle with the items you have in the trunk and glove compartment, as they will be lost along with the car.
