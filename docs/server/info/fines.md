## Paying Fines

Fines are issued by the police following violations of the penal code. These are not automatically paid by the player but recorded at the town hall to be paid later.

To see the complete list of fines recorded under your name, you need to go to the town hall and interact with our NPC "NPC Andreea Fines & Licenses." Fines can be paid preferentially based on the age of the fine or its value, according to your preference.

Upon accumulating 4 unpaid fines, you will no longer be able to work legally (at jobs marked on GPS), so it is crucial to always have your fines paid. If, however, you choose not to pay your fines, you should consider that opportunities to join government factions (police, medics & mechanics) may decrease.
