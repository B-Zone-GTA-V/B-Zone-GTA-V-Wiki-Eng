## Animation System

On the server, there are currently 3 types of animations that you can use:
- Generic animations
- Facial animations
- Walking styles

These animations can be accessed from the K menu -> Animations OR through:

- [/e] -> generic animations 
- [/walk] -> walking styles

For a quicker activation of animations, the server provides you with the following approaches:
- The ability to use [/e] followed by the animation name without accessing one of the menus, for example: [/e mechanic2].
- The ability to use the command [/saveanimation] to add up to 9 animations to favorites, which can be triggered from the K menu -> Animations -> Quick Animations (see video for the English version).
- Animations can be interrupted using the command [/c] in the chat.
