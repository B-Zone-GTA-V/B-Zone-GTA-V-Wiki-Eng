## Update your document

When the character is finalized, a photo will be taken, which will be used when showing your documents to another player.

If you change your appearance (hair/color of hair/makeup) and want the photo in the documents to reflect how your character looks, you can always take a new photo for the documents.

To take a new photo, you need to go to the first floor of the town hall, where you can interact with the "NPC Document Photo Change." After interacting with the NPC, if you have the necessary amount ($5,000), you will be directed to a checkpoint. At that checkpoint, a new photo will be taken and displayed in the documents.
