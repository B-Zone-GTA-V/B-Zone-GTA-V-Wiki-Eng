## Licenses

Licenses are acquired or obtained through player actions. On the server, there are a total of 7 licenses that can be purchased from the City Hall/DMV.

- Fishing license 
- Mining license
- Oversized transport license 
- Firearms carrying license
- Driving license
- Sailing license
- Flying license

Licenses can be purchased from the City Hall for a period between one day and a maximum of 300 days or from the DMV.

The driver's license is acquired in the first phase at the location marked on the GPS (DMV), where you have to pass a theory and a practical test. If the license is suspended OR expires later, the only possibility to acquire it is through the police (they can give you the license after a test). It is worth noting that you can still drive without an active license, but you are prone to penalties from the police.

Boat navigation and piloting licenses are obtained from the same place as the driving license, DMV. To be able to take the tests you need:
- For the boat license: minimum 250 hours spent on the server and the amount of $50,000
- For the Helicopter Pilot License: minimum 500 hours spent on the server and the amount of $100,000

The reacquisition of these two licenses is done by repeating the tests at the DMV.

Fishing, mining and bulk transport licenses allow players to do completely legal jobs and not be fined by the police when stopped for a routine check. Job activity is NOT affected by a license (you can also work without active licenses, but you are prone to penalties from the police).

The firearms carrying license can only be obtained from the police after passing a test.
