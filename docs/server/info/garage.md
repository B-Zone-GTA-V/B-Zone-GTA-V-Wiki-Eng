## Garage System

The garage system is designed to allow various vehicles to be positioned throughout the game area.

A vehicle parked in a garage can only be taken out from that specific garage, with engine damage as well as items in the trunk and glove compartment being saved at the moment the vehicle is parked.

A fee of $50 is charged for parking the vehicle, and in case it is totaled, an additional fee will be paid to the mechanics to be able to remove the vehicle from their garage.

There are 3 types of garages:
- For parking personal cars / motorcycles
- For parking helicopters
- For parking boats
