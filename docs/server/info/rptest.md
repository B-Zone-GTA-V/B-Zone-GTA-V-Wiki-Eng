## Roleplay Test

Immediately after creating the account and customizing the character, the player will be redirected to a special interior where they will undergo the RolePlay test.

This consists of a set of 15 randomly generated questions out of a total of 30 possible questions, each answer being generated differently to prevent coincidences with other players' answers. In case the player answers incorrectly to any of the questions, the interface will close, and the test will be considered failed. However, the player can retake the test from the beginning without being able to save the previous progress.

The RolePlay test also has a time limit of 30 minutes, and if the time expires, the test will be automatically failed.
