## Gym

There are two gyms available, one in Vespucci and one at the prison.

Each gym exercise consumes a quantity of water.

Lack of exercise will cause a decrease in your toning, thus reducing the maximum number of kilograms you can carry.

NOTE 1: If you have a VIP Gold or Diamond account, you will have a boost of max kg that you can train at the gym, 5kg and 10kg respectively. The respective kilograms must be worked out at the gym, they are NOT received at the time of purchasing the VIP account.

NOTE 2: Losing the VIP account will not remove the extra kilograms, but you will not be able to work out until you drop below the new limit.

Clarification Max KG: 5kg (pockets) + 40kg (best backpack) + 20kg (gym) + 10kg (VIP Diamond) = 75kg
