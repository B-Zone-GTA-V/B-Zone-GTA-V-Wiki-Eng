## ATM

Through the books system you can convert and transfer your experience points from one skill to another player at a conversion rate of 3:1. The book writing location is in the town hall building, on the ground floor, in the left wing, first room on the right.

You can only write cards if you have skill 6 + the number of points used (see table below).

To write a book, you need a notebook that can be bought in any 24/7 store.
